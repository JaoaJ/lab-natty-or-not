Artificial Intelligence

In the digital world, a mind arises,
Made of codes, precise and wise.
It learns and grows, never at rest,
Announcing a new era, at its best.

In data, it finds its knowledge,
In algorithms, it starts to acknowledge.
With logic and precision, it goes beyond,
Unraveling mysteries that humans havenâ€™t found.

In machines, a spark of innovation,
Turning dreams into realization.
From autonomous cars to precise diagnoses,
AI guides us through unforeseen courses.

But let us always remember, with care and love,
That human creation is its guiding glove.
May ethics and caution be our guide,
So artificial intelligence brings only pride.
